import torch.nn as nn

class DeepThinker(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_type='transformer'):
        super().__init__()
        self.model_type = model_type
        self.encoder = TransformerEncoder()
        self.reasoning_layers = nn.ModuleList([

        for layer in self.reasoning_layers:
            x = layer(x, context)
        return x

class ReasoningLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_size, 8)

### **LuluAI Deep Think**  
*Cognitive AI System for Multi-Stage Reasoning and Decision Intelligence*

**LuluAI Deep Think** is an advanced artificial intelligence framework designed to emulate human-like reasoning processes through a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture. Unlike traditional AI models that focus on pattern recognition alone, this system implements a **multi-phase cognitive pipeline** that combines:  
- Deep learning for contextual understanding  
- Symbolic logic for rule-based deduction  
- Knowledge graph integration for structured reasoning  
- Recursive verification for error correction  

The system specializes in **complex problem-solving tasks** requiring:  
🔍 Multi-step logical inference  
🌐 Cross-domain knowledge integration  
📊 Uncertainty quantification  
📝 Explainable decision trails  

### Key Differentiators  
| Feature | Description |  
|---------|-------------|  
| **Dual Reasoning Engine** | Parallel neural network (Transformer-based) + symbolic logic processor |  
| **Dynamic Knowledge Fusion** | Real-time integration of structured data and unstructured text |  
| **Cognitive Mirroring** | Implements human-inspired reasoning stages: Perception → Abstraction → Hypothesis → Validation |  
| **Transparency Layer** | Generates natural language explanations for all conclusions |  

### Use Cases  
- Strategic decision support systems  
- Scientific hypothesis generation  
- Legal/policy analysis frameworks  
- Enterprise risk modeling  
- Educational tutoring systems  

### Technical Architecture  
```  
Input → [Perception Module] → [Abstraction Engine] →  
[Neural-Symbolic Interface] → [Hypothesis Generator] →  
[Confidence Evaluator] → [Explanation Synthesizer] → Output  
```  

**Core Components:**  
1. **Neural Understanding Layer**  
   - Context-aware text interpretation using modified Transformer architecture  
   - Adaptive attention mechanisms for long-chain reasoning  

2. **Symbolic Operations Unit**  
   - First-order logic prover with probabilistic extensions  
   - Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver  

3. **Knowledge Orchestrator**  
   - Manages dynamic knowledge graphs (entities + relationships + metadata)  
   - Supports temporal reasoning and counterfactual analysis  

4. **Metacognition Module**  
   - Monitors internal reasoning quality  
   - Activates error recovery protocols when confidence thresholds are breached  

### Development Philosophy  
Built on three fundamental principles:  
1. **Cognitive Fidelity** - Mirror human problem-solving stages while leveraging AI scalability  
2. **Responsible AI** - Built-in bias detection and uncertainty quantification  
3. **Evolutionary Design** - Architecture supports continuous learning and paradigm updates  

**Target Users:**  
- AI researchers exploring neuro-symbolic integration  
- Enterprises needing auditable decision systems
